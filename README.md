# Intro
The repository contains solutions to about 1000 programming problems that I completed between July 
20, 2021 and February 8, 2022. I love the code I write. Where the job verification system allowed 
me, it is my code that is presented. Sometimes the validator, for some reason, gave part of the code
ready or replaced what I wrote. Sometimes the inspector's demands seemed absurd to me, but I was 
forced to obey. I think you can easily find such areas. I left them mostly as they are.
